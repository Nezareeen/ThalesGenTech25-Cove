# Cove: Your AI-Powered Guide to Weather and Exploration

## Project Description

Cove is an innovative, AI-powered platform designed to provide intuitive weather insights and personalized travel recommendations. Our goal is to move beyond traditional, data-heavy applications by simplifying complex environmental information into actionable, intelligent advice. At the heart of Cove is an AI model that suggests practical actions based on current weather, while also serving as a scout for the best places to visit in any given location.

The platform provides a user-friendly interface for travelers and residents alike, offering a curated experience that takes into account real-time factors like traffic, crowd density, and temperature. By integrating historical context and an interactive AI chatbot, Cove empowers users to make informed decisions and fully immerse themselves in their surroundings.
